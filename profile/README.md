Snowflake is a framework for building extensible frontends for modern emulators. 

## Main Projects

* ‚ùÑÔ∏è [**Snowflake**](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake) is where the core framework lives and undergoes development.
* ü™® [Stone](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/stone) provides standardized, RFC compiliant identifiers to gaming platforms, game content formats, and controller layouts.
* üéÆ [snowflake-ingame](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake-ingame) provides Snowflake's in-game overlay and other facilities like process memory access to frontend plugins.
* üíæ [snowflake-projfs](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake-projfs) provides filesystem isolation and projection for emulators orchestrated by Snowflake.
* ‚öõÔ∏è [hydrogen-paper](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/hydrogen-paper) is the default theme of Snowflake that implements an emulator frontend using the Snowflake framework.
